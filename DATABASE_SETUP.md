# Database Integration Setup

Your stored procedures are working! Now let's integrate them with your JavaScript application.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/miguelfribeiro/closure_Demo
npm run install-deps
```

### 2. Start the API Server
```bash
npm run api-server
```

This will:
- Connect to your SQL Server database (localhost,1433)
- Start an API server on http://localhost:3001
- Serve your demo application
- Execute your stored procedures

### 3. Open Your Application
Navigate to: http://localhost:3001

## 🔧 How It Works

### Database Service Layer
- `src/database-service.js` - Handles all database communication
- Calls API endpoints that execute your stored procedures
- Includes caching for performance

### API Server
- `server/api-server.js` - Node.js server that executes stored procedures
- Provides REST endpoints for your frontend
- Handles SQL Server connection and query execution

### Integration Points
Your existing code structure remains the same, but now:
- `getAllResources()` calls `FavoritesDemo.sp_GetAllResources`
- `getFrequentlyVisited()` calls `FavoritesDemo.sp_GetFrequentlyVisited`
- `addFavorite()` calls `FavoritesDemo.sp_AddFavorite`
- All other operations use your stored procedures

## 📋 Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/resources` | GET | Get all resources |
| `/api/frequently-visited` | GET | Get frequently visited |
| `/api/favorites` | GET | Get user favorites |
| `/api/favorites` | POST | Add favorite |
| `/api/favorites` | DELETE | Remove favorite |
| `/api/favorites/all` | DELETE | Clear all favorites |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the Integration**: Open http://localhost:3001 and try adding/removing favorites
2. **Monitor the Console**: You'll see database calls being logged
3. **Check SQL Server**: Your stored procedures will be executed with real data
4. **Verify in Database**: Use VS Code MSSQL extension to see the changes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If the API server can't connect to SQL Server:
- Check that SQL Server is running
- Verify Windows Authentication is enabled

## 🏃‍♂️ Run It Now

```bash
npm run install-deps && npm run api-server
```

Then open http://localhost:3001 and test your database-powered favorites app!
