 * ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON - MONOLITHIC VS MODULAR
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * This file demonstrates the differences between the two approaches:
 * 1. Original monolithic design (removed - was favorites-store.js)
 * 2. New modular design (favorites-store-modular.js + modules)
 */

// =============================================================================
// MONOLITHIC APPROACH (Original)
// =============================================================================

/**
 * PROS:
 * ✅ Everything in one file - easy to understand initially
 * ✅ No module coordination complexity
 * ✅ Self-contained with all patterns demonstrated
 * ✅ Good for educational purposes and smaller projects
 * 
 * CONS:
 * ❌ Single file becomes large and hard to navigate (650+ lines)
 * ❌ Mixing multiple responsibilities in one place
 * ❌ Hard to test individual patterns in isolation
 * ❌ Difficult to reuse specific parts in other projects
 * ❌ Changes to one pattern affect the entire file
 * ❌ Harder to have multiple developers work on different parts
 */

// =============================================================================
// MODULAR APPROACH (New)
// =============================================================================

/**
 * PROS:
 * ✅ Clear separation of concerns (each module has one responsibility)
 * ✅ Each module is independently testable
 * ✅ Easy to modify or extend individual modules
 * ✅ Better code organization and navigation
 * ✅ Modules can be reused in different contexts
 * ✅ Multiple developers can work on different modules
 * ✅ Follows SOLID principles
 * ✅ Better IDE support (smaller files, clear imports)
 * ✅ Easier to debug specific functionality
 * 
 * CONS:
 * ❌ More files to manage
 * ❌ Need to understand module coordination
 * ❌ Slightly more complex setup initially

// =============================================================================
// WHEN TO USE EACH APPROACH
// =============================================================================

/**
 * USE MONOLITHIC WHEN:
 * - Building a small prototype or demo
 * - Learning/teaching design patterns
 * - Simple applications with limited scope
 * - Solo development projects
 * - Quick experiments or proofs of concept
 * 
 * USE MODULAR WHEN:
 * - Building production applications
 * - Working with a team
 * - Planning to extend functionality over time
 * - Need to reuse components in multiple projects
 * - Code maintainability is important
 * - Different developers will work on different features
 * - You want comprehensive testing coverage
 */

// =============================================================================
// TESTING COMPARISON
// =============================================================================

/**
 * MONOLITHIC TESTING:
 * - Test the entire store as a black box
 * - Harder to isolate specific pattern behaviors
 * - Tests become complex as they need to test everything
 * 
 * MODULAR TESTING:
 * - Test each module independently
 * - Mock dependencies for isolated testing
 * - More focused test cases
 * - Easier to achieve high code coverage
 * - Can test edge cases in specific modules
 */

// =============================================================================
// MIGRATION STRATEGY
// =============================================================================

/**
 * If you have a monolithic store and want to migrate:
 * 
 * 1. EXTRACT STATE MANAGEMENT:
 *    - Move data operations to state-store.js
 *    - Keep interface the same initially
 * 
 * 2. EXTRACT OBSERVERS:
 *    - Move notification logic to observer-manager.js
 *    - Maintain subscription API
 * 
 * 3. EXTRACT COMMANDS:
 *    - Move undo/redo to command-manager.js
 *    - Keep history methods intact
 * 
 * 4. EXTRACT ACTIONS:
 *    - Move action creators to action-definitions.js
 *    - Ensure command objects remain compatible
 * 
 * 5. CREATE ORCHESTRATOR:
 *    - Wire everything together in main store file
 *    - Maintain backward compatibility
 * 
 * 6. UPDATE IMPORTS:
 *    - Switch consumers to use modular store
 *    - Remove old monolithic file
